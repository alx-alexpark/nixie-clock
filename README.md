# ИН-12 Nixie Tube Clock

A nixie tube clock made using ИН-12 (IN-12) tubes. Uses k155id1 drivers and a boost converter made using [this reference design](https://github.com/drkmsmithjr/NixiePowerSupply). Time is synchronized over WiFi using NTP while only being ~1sec off, and all firmware is written using CircuitPython.
